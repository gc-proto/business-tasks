	<p>GST/HST Info Sheet GI-196<br>
June 2016</p>
<p>This info sheet provides self-employed commercial ride-sharing drivers with information regarding the proposed amendment to the GST/HST definition of &quot;taxi business&quot; in the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> that was announced in Budget 2017 on March 22, 2017, by the Minister of Finance. This amendment is included in Bill C-44, the <em>Budget&nbsp;Implementation&nbsp;Act,&nbsp;2017,&nbsp;No.1</em>, which received Royal Assent on June&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2017.</p>
<p>Effective July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, as a self-employed commercial ride-sharing driver who provides taxable supplies of ride-sharing services, you will be required to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./register-en.html">register for the GST/HST</a>, regardless of your total annual revenues from taxable supplies;</li>
<li><a href="./charge-1-en.html">charge and collect the GST/HST</a> on the ride-sharing services;</li>
<li><a href="./return-1-en.html">complete and file a return</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="./remit-pay-gst-hst-including-instalment-payments.html">pay (remit) the GST/HST</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In certain circumstances, some ride-sharing companies that you operate with and that you have duly authorized may agree to carry out some of these obligations on your behalf.</p>
<p>This publication explains these obligations and the various simplified GST/HST measures that are available to you including:</p>
<ul>
<li>registering online;</li>
<li>filing and remitting annually and online;</li>
<li>using the Quick Method to calculate your net tax if you meet the relevant conditions; and</li>
<li>authorizing a representative to undertake your GST/HST obligations on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these measures are optional, some ride-sharing companies that you operate with may require you to consent to using them.</p>
<h2>Change to the definition of &quot;taxi business&quot;</h2>
<p>For GST/HST purposes, a &quot;taxi business&quot; is currently defined as a business carried on in Canada of transporting passengers by taxi for fares that are regulated under the laws of Canada or a province.</p>
<p>Based on this definition, all taxi operators are required to register for the GST/HST and to charge and collect tax on their fares, regardless of whether their total annual revenues from taxable supplies exceed the $30,000 small supplier threshold.</p>
<p>To ensure that the GST/HST applies consistently to taxi services and commercial ride-sharing services, the definition of a taxi business has been amended effective July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, to also include persons carrying on a business of transporting passengers for fares by motor vehicle within a municipality and its environs if the transportation is arranged or coordinated through an electronic platform or system, such as a mobile application or website.</p>
<p>The amended definition will only apply to taxable supplies of passenger transportation services that are made in the course of a commercial activity. You will be considered to be making such supplies once you start providing commercial ride-sharing services, including commercial carpool services. A commercial activity generally means a business carried on by a person (and in the case of an individual, carried on with a reasonable expectation of profit), except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person. Exempt supplies are supplies that are not subject to the GST/HST.</p>
<p>The amended definition will not apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the part of a business that is the operation of a sightseeing service or the school transportation of elementary or secondary students;</li>
<li>a business or activity of a business that is prescribed by regulation (to date no businesses or activities have been prescribed);</li>
<li>an exempt supply of a passenger transportation service such as a supply of a municipal transit service by a transit authority; or</li>
<li>non-commercial ride-sharing, including non-commercial carpooling, that does not involve the making of taxable supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>For purposes of the amended definition, a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; means a motor vehicle that is designed or adapted primarily to carry individuals on highways and streets and that has a seating capacity for not more than the driver and eight passengers, and includes a motor vehicle:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquired primarily for use as a taxi, or</li>
<li>of a type commonly called a van or pick-up truck, or a similar vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Registering as a small supplier</h2>

<p>As a self-employed driver making taxable supplies of commercial ride-sharing services you will be required to be <a href="./register-en.html">registered for the GST/HST</a> on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, in respect of those services. This is regardless of whether you are a small supplier.</p>


<p>Generally, a small supplier refers to a person whose total revenue (along with the revenue of all persons associated with that person) from worldwide taxable supplies was equal to or less than $30,000 ($50,000 for public service bodies) in a calendar quarter and over the last four consecutive calendar quarters.</p>
<p>Although your effective date of registration will be the particular day on which you start to make taxable supplies, you will only be required to apply to the CRA for registration before the thirtieth day after that particular day. Therefore, if you are making taxable supplies of commercial ride-sharing services on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, you will be required to apply for registration by July&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2017, and your effective date of registration will be July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017. However, if you only start to make taxable supplies of commercial ride-sharing services after July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, such as September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, you will not be required to have registered for the GST/HST until September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2017, and your effective date of registration will be September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to register as soon as possible. When applying for registration, you may request that your registration only become effective as of the July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017 effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>If you are a small supplier who makes taxable supplies of commercial ride-sharing services and other taxable supplies your registration will generally only apply in respect of your commercial ride-sharing services unless you request otherwise. This means that you will not be required to charge the GST/HST in respect of your other taxable supplies, nor will you be entitled to claim input tax credits (ITCs) in relation to those supplies (ITCs are explained later in this publication). However, if your combined total annual revenue from taxable supplies of commercial ride-sharing services and other taxable supplies exceeds $30,000 (for example, $20,000 for commercial ride-sharing services and $15,000 for other taxable supplies), you will not be considered a small supplier. You will therefore be required to charge and collect tax on all of your revenues from your taxable supplies (the combined $35,000).</p>
<p>If you are already registered for the GST/HST, including with respect to another commercial activity, you are automatically considered to be registered with respect to your commercial ride-sharing services and are not required to apply for registration again.</p>



<h2>Authorizing a representative</h2>
<p>You may authorize a representative to register, file, and remit on your behalf. For further information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/authorizing-a-representative-overview.html">Authorizing a representative</a>.</p>
