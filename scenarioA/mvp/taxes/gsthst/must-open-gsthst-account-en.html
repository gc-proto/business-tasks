<p dir="LTR">Do <strong>not</strong> claim a rebate under <span class="nowrap"><strong>reason code 1A</strong></span> if you have paid the 8% <strong>provincial part</strong> of the HST in Ontario for the purchase of qualifying off-reserve property or services after <span class="nowrap">June 2010 and you are:</span></p>

Do <strong>not</strong> use Form GST189 to apply for the <span class="nowrap">8%</span> provincial rebate.</p>
<p dir="LTR">If you believe you paid an amount as GST/HST in error to a supplier, you can request a refund or credit of the amount from the supplier instead of applying for a rebate under <span class="nowrap"><strong>reason code 1A</strong></span>. This is often the simplest way for you to recover the amount. If the supplier gives you a refund or credit, you are no longer eligible for a rebate because the amount you paid in error has already been refunded or credited to you.</p>

<p>If you are a public service body such as a charity, you may be eligible to designate your branch or division to be a small supplier for GST/HST purposes. The branch or division would be treated as a <strong>separate person </strong>that is a small supplier. Your organization would <strong>not</strong> collect GST/HST on taxable supplies made through the small supplier division, and it would <strong>not</strong> be entitled to claim input tax credits for purchases made in relation to the small supplier division.</p>
<p>To make the election, use <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst31.html">form GST31, Application by a Public Service Body to Have Branches or Divisions Designated as Eligible Small Supplier Divisions</a><br>

        <h4>How to designate your branch or division to be a small supplier</h4>
<p>If you are a public service body, you may be eligible to designate your branch or division to be a small supplier for GST/HST purposes. The branch or division would be treated as a <strong>separate person </strong>that is a small supplier. Your organization would <strong>not</strong> collect GST/HST on taxable supplies made through the small supplier division, and it would <strong>not</strong> be entitled to claim input tax credits for purchases made in relation to the small supplier division.</p>
<p>To make the election, use form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst31.html">GST31, Application by a Public Service Body to Have Branches or Divisions Designated as Eligible Small Supplier Divisions</a><br>
